# Post-estimation shrinkage methods
Edwin Kipruto, Willi Sauerbrei
Maintained by Edwin Kipruto
This project implements post-estimation shrinkage methods: global shrinkage, parameter-wise shrinkage (PWS), nonnegative PWS (NPWS), and quadratic shrinkage approach (QPWS), as described in Kipruto and Sauerbrei (2024). It also includes tools for running simulations to compare post-estimation shrinkage approaches with penalized regression methods (lasso and ridge).

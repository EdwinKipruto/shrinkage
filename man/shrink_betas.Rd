\title{Calculate shrinkage factors between two beta matrices}
\usage{
shrink_betas(beta1, beta2, exclude = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta1}{The beta matrix used to calculate shrinkage factors (e.g., full
model or backward elimination without post-estimation shrinkage).}

\item{beta2}{The beta matrix from a regression procedure that has already 
employed shrinkage (e.g., backward elimination with global shrinkage).}

\item{exclude}{A numeric vector specifying the column indices of variables to
be excluded in both beta matrices.}
}
\value{
A matrix of shrinkage factors with the same dimensions as the input
matrices, or a subset of it if variables are excluded.
}
\description{
This function takes two matrices of beta coefficients and calculates the 
shrinkage factors by dividing beta1 by beta2. It can handle cases where 
certain variables need to be excluded in the calculation.
}
\examples{
beta1 <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2)
beta2 <- matrix(c(0.5, 0.5, 2, 2, 3, 3), nrow = 2)
shrink_betas(beta1, beta2)
}
